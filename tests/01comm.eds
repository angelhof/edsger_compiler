this is only meant to be a long comment

   Last night I dreamt that somebody loved me
   No hope, no harm, just another false alarm
   Last night I felt real arms around me
   No hope, no harm, just another false alarm
   But tell me how long before the last one
   And tell me how long before the right one
   This story is old, I know, but it goes on

but while we're at it, let's check a few other things too...
