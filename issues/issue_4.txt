Subject: 
Nested recursive functions and their variables scope into inner functions

Proposed Solution:
This seems like a very complicated problem that has two seemingly easy solutions . Make all variables global in nested functions, or pass them as parameters. THough both of these ways are not working efficiently. Try to search about closure and variable auto linkage.
